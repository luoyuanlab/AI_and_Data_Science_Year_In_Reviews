# Health Care AI and Data Science Year In Reviews
The Health Care AI and Data Science Year In Review is an annual retrospective that highlights the most significant advancements, challenges, and forward-looking trends in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science within healthcare and biomedical research. This comprehensive overview showcases the collaborative efforts between clinicians, researchers, and technologists, emphasizing innovations in machine learning models, large language models (LLMs), and generative AI (genAI) that have potential to revolutionize patient care, diagnostics, and therapeutic development. It also examines the integration of multimodal data sources and ethical considerations surrounding AI deployment in clinical settings. The review serves as a vital resource for the informatics community, providing insights into the current state of AI and Data Science, identifying gaps in knowledge, and suggesting directions for future research and application in healthcare to improve outcomes and efficiency.

This Year In Review, annually presented at the AMIA Informatics Summit, was originally conceived by Dr. Luo, who recognized the importance of documenting and reflecting on the yearly progress within the fields of AI and Data Science in healthcare. Understanding the value of diverse insights and the dynamic nature of these fields, Dr. Luo established the tradition of collaborating with a different colleague each year to co-author the review. This practice ensures that the review incorporates a wide range of perspectives, highlighting not only the technical advancements and innovations but also the challenges, ethical considerations, and the broader impact of these technologies on healthcare and biomedical research. By inviting contributions from various experts, Dr. Luo's initiative fosters a collaborative spirit within the informatics community, encouraging the exchange of ideas and promoting a comprehensive understanding of how AI and Data Science continue to evolve and influence healthcare.
